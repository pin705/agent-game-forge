# Genre — Side-scroller / Platformer

Side-view games. The genre splits into TWO distinct shapes based on `spec.combat_style`:

| `combat_style` | Examples | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `standard` / `heavy` | Mega Man X, Castlevania, Hollow Knight, Shovel Knight | **Action platformer** — player attacks, enemies, boss. Use seed + recipes as-is. |
| `none` | Celeste, INSIDE, Geometry Dash, Limbo | **Pure platformer** — no attacks, no enemies. STRIP combat modules. See "Pure-platformer mode" section below. |
| `light` | early Mario, Donkey Kong barrel scenes | Simple enemies as obstacles, no boss. Use full seed but skip boss phases. |

**Recurring failure**: spec writer reads "side-scroll" and assumes Mega Man Zero by default — every project gets enemies + boss + attack anim. Then user complaint: "I picked reach-goal + no combat but agent gave me boss anyway." (test-2d-scroll, 2026.) `combat_style` field in the discovery form is BINDING — honor it. Pure platformer with `combat_style: none` is a real game shape (Celeste sold 1M+ copies, INSIDE won GOTY), don't fight it.

## Pure-platformer mode (when `combat_style = none`)

Phase 0 still copies the foundation seed verbatim. But spec writer + agent MUST then:

**Delete from seed (after Phase 0 copy)** — these modules become dead weight in pure-platformer:
- `src/entities/attack.js` — delete
- `src/entities/enemy.js` — delete
- `src/entities/projectiles.js` — delete
- `data/enemies.json` — delete (or leave `[]` for catalog API symmetry)
- `data/projectiles.json` — delete (or leave `[]`)

**Update from seed**:
- `index.html` — remove the `<script src="src/entities/attack.js"></script>`, `.../enemy.js`, `.../projectiles.js` lines. Without this, the page hits 404 on missing files and silently breaks.
- `data/player-config.json` — drop the `attack` animation entry. Keep only `idle / walk / jump`.
- `src/entities/player.js` — delete the `wasPressed("attack") && p.attackCooldown <= 0` branch and `startPlayerAttack()` call. Delete `attackTimer / attackCooldown / attack` state fields. Player FSM keeps `idle / walk / jump` actions only.
- `src/render.js` — delete `drawAttacks` call from `drawLevel`. The `drawAttacks` function itself can stay (dead but harmless) or be removed.
- `src/scene.js` `updateScene` — remove `updateAttacks(dt)` and `updateProjectiles(dt)` calls. `updateEnemies(dt)` should be wrapped in `if (state.enemies && state.enemies.length > 0)` or removed entirely.

**Phase plan for `combat_style: none`** — replace the standard 10-14 phase plan with this shape:

```
Phase 1: Visual anchor
Phase 2: Level 1 parallax map + platform library
Phase 3: Level 1 platforming layout (platforms, hazards, pickups, checkpoints, exit)
Phase 4: Player sprite sheets (idle / walk / jump only — no attack)
Phase 5: Player controller (movement + double jump + camera + checkpoint respawn)
Phase 6: Pickups + hazards (catalog + level placement + scoring)
Phase 7: Platforming challenges (moving platforms / timing puzzles / collectibles variety / secrets)
Phase 8: HUD + lives + save + game-over
Phase 9: Story panels + win flow (reach-portal animation, victory state)
Phase 10: Audio + juice (sfx, particles, screenshake on landing/death)
```

Notice: **NO enemy phases, NO boss phase**. Replace what would've been "enemy 1/2/3" + "boss" with platforming-variety phases (Phase 7 is the swap target).

**Recipes that DON'T apply in pure-platformer mode**:
- `recipes/side-scroll/combat-melee.md` — skip
- `recipes/side-scroll/enemy-patrol.md` — skip
- `recipes/side-scroll/projectiles.md` — skip

**Recipes that DO apply**:
- `recipes/side-scroll/parallax-layers.md`
- `recipes/side-scroll/platform-three-piece.md`
- `recipes/side-scroll/hazards-and-pits.md` — hazards become the main "danger" source (spikes, pits, electric, lava); kill colliders are key for one-hit-death pure-platformer (Celeste/Meat Boy)
- `recipes/side-scroll/checkpoints-respawn.md` — checkpoints become extra critical when there's no combat HP buffer

## Standard / heavy combat mode

Mega Man X, Mario, Castlevania-style side-view action games. Use seed + all recipes as-is.

**Canonical reference**: [Mike Hadley's Phaser 3 tilemap series](https://github.com/mikewesthad/phaser-3-tilemap-blog-posts) — author of Phaser's tilemap API. The `posts/post-2/03-drawing-platformer/` example shows everything in one place. Read it for the PATTERN.

> ⚠️ **OGF projects do NOT use Phaser** — vanilla Canvas 2D only. References below are pattern inspiration. See `runtime-patterns.md` for the Phaser → vanilla translation table. The code samples in this file are already vanilla canvas; copy those, not Phaser snippets from the linked tutorials.

This file assumes you've also read `runtime-patterns.md` (delta time, AABB, FSM, scroll factor, etc — those are universal).

## Generation procedure — view_image + skill call as paired tool_uses

EVERY `generate2dmap` / `generate2dsprite` call MUST be preceded by `view_image` of the closest existing reference, in the SAME message. See `common.md` "Visual consistency" for the canonical pattern + reasoning.

```
Phase 2 (parallax layers — first per-segment image):
  tool_use 1: view_image .ogf/style-anchor.png
  tool_use 2: generate2dmap reference: 'generated_image'
              prompt: "[STYLE...] [VIEW...] side-scroll parallax
                       <layer-name>, segment 1 of 2..."

Phase 3 (platform tile pack):
  tool_use 1: view_image .ogf/style-anchor.png
  tool_use 2: generate2dmap (or generate2dsprite for tile pack)
              reference: 'generated_image'

Phase 4 (player anims — after first idle exists):
  Phase 4a (idle, first time):
    tool_use 1: view_image .ogf/style-anchor.png
    tool_use 2: generate2dsprite reference: 'generated_image'
  Phase 4b (walk, idle now exists — reference idle for character identity):
    tool_use 1: view_image assets/sprites/player/idle/sheet.png
    tool_use 2: generate2dsprite reference: 'generated_image'
                prompt: "Same character, new animation: walk cycle..."
```

Skipping view_image → blind generation → degenerate output (flat vector geometric shapes when "pixel art" requested, palette drift, character faces inconsistent across animations).

### Process strategy for character action sheets

When you run `scripts/generate2dsprite.py process` on player / enemy / boss action sheets, use **`--scale-strategy preserve --align feet`** for ALL their actions (idle, walk, jump, attack, hurt, etc.). This is the SKILL.md default — preserve keeps weapons, capes, slash arcs, and aura FX intact instead of vertically compressing wide attack poses.

**Hard rule**: every action sheet for the same character uses the same strategy. Don't process idle with default fit and attack with preserve — the character will visibly shrink between animations (test-2d-gpg2 nobunaga: idle 139px / attack 102px = 27% drift). Pick preserve at the first action and stick with it.

`fit` is for: projectiles, item pickups, hit-spark / muzzle-flash FX sheets, UI sprites — small grid-uniform assets where cell-fitting matters more than artistic preservation.

## Camera — camera-window + lookahead, NOT raw lerp

Side-scrolling cameras have a small set of established patterns. Itay Keren catalogued them in [Scroll Back](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/scroll-back-the-theory-and-practice-of-cameras-in-side-scrollers). For OGF, the **canonical pattern is camera-window + lookahead + platform-snapping** (this is what Mega Man X uses):

- **Camera window**: a region in the middle of the screen the player can move within without the camera moving. Camera only scrolls when the player tries to leave the window.
- **Lookahead**: when player faces right, camera target shifts right ~80px so the player sees more of where they're going. Same flipped on left.
- **Platform-snapping**: only re-center vertically when the player is grounded — prevents motion sickness during jumps.
- **Bounds clamp**: camera never shows outside the level (`mapSize.width` / `mapSize.height`).

Implementation sketch (vanilla web, ~40 lines in `src/scene.js`):

```js
// State carried in the scene
let camLookahead = 0; // smoothed
let camY = 0;        // platform-snap target

function updateCamera(player, dt) {
  // 1. Smooth the lookahead so facing changes don't snap (CRITICAL — otherwise
  //    walking back jumps the camera 160px in one frame)
  const desired = player.facing.x * 80;
  camLookahead += (desired - camLookahead) * Math.min(1, dt * 4);

  // 2. X target = player center + lookahead (camera-window logic optional;
  //    minimal version is just lerp toward target)
  const targetX = player.x + player.w/2 - viewport.w/2 + camLookahead;

  // 3. Y only re-centers when grounded (platform snapping)
  if (player.grounded) camY = player.y + player.h/2 - viewport.h/2;
  // else camY stays as-is during jumps

  // 4. Clamp to map bounds
  camera.x = clamp(targetX, 0, mapSize.width  - viewport.w);
  camera.y = clamp(camY,    0, mapSize.height - viewport.h);
}
```

**Anti-pattern**: setting `targetX = player.x + player.facing.x * 80` (no lerp) — when player turns from right to left, target jumps by 160px in one frame and the camera snaps. Always smooth lookahead.

**Anti-pattern**: tracking player Y rigidly during jumps — Keren calls this "Y-axis chaos". Use platform-snap (only re-center on ground).

## Background — 1280×720 tileable strips + repeatX (4 layers)

Canonical implementation: **every parallax layer is a 1280×720 (or 1664×720 — must be ÷16 for gpt-image-2) tileable strip**, the runtime tiles each horizontally via `repeatX: true` at its own scroll speed. NO mega-wide single images, NO post-stretch.

```json
"layers": [
  { "id": "sky",     "image": "assets/maps/lvl1/sky.png",     "parallax": 0.04, "zIndex": 0, "repeatX": true },
  { "id": "far_bg",  "image": "assets/maps/lvl1/far_bg.png",  "parallax": 0.20, "zIndex": 1, "repeatX": true },
  { "id": "mid_bg",  "image": "assets/maps/lvl1/mid_bg.png",  "parallax": 0.50, "zIndex": 2, "repeatX": true },
  { "id": "near_bg", "image": "assets/maps/lvl1/near_bg.png", "parallax": 0.85, "zIndex": 3, "repeatX": true }
]
```

### Critical: per-layer transparency

For parallax depth to be visible, layers above sky MUST have transparent regions so the layers behind show through. Implementation = magenta chroma-key (same convention as sprites):

| Layer | Opaque/Transparent | Magenta convention |
|---|---|---|
| sky | OPAQUE | NO magenta — entirely filled |
| far_bg | TRANSPARENT above silhouette | YES — #FF00FF above silhouette + in gaps |
| mid_bg | TRANSPARENT outside silhouette | YES — same |
| near_bg | TRANSPARENT outside silhouette | YES — same |

**The first agent attempt almost always gets this wrong** — generates 4 opaque scenes from 4 viewpoints and stacks them. Only near_bg (top zIndex) shows; parallax effect is invisible. Use the magenta-bg convention from sprites for far/mid/near.

### Post-processing pipeline

After image_gen produces each layer (typically 1672×941 raw), pipe through:

```bash
# Sky (keep opaque):
python .agents/skills/generate2dmap/scripts/process_parallax_layer.py \
  --input raw-sky.png --output assets/maps/lvl1/sky.png --keep-magenta

# Far / mid / near (chroma-key magenta → transparent):
python .agents/skills/generate2dmap/scripts/process_parallax_layer.py \
  --input raw-far.png --output assets/maps/lvl1/far_bg.png
```

Script does: LANCZOS downscale to 1280×720 (16:9 → 16:9, no aspect distortion) + chroma-key + edge-fringe flood-fill + seam diagnostic.

### Runtime renderer (already in seed)

`src/parallax.js`:
```js
function drawParallax(ctx, level) {
  const layers = (level.layers || []).slice().sort((a, b) => (a.zIndex || 0) - (b.zIndex || 0));
  for (const layer of layers) {
    const img = assetCache.images.get(layer.image);
    if (!img || img instanceof Promise) continue;
    const scroll = layer.parallax ?? 1;
    ctx.save();
    ctx.globalAlpha = layer.opacity ?? 1;
    if (layer.repeatX) {
      const offset = -((state.camera.x * scroll) % img.width);
      for (let x = offset - img.width; x < VIEW.w + img.width; x += img.width) {
        ctx.drawImage(img, Math.round(x), 0, img.width, VIEW.h);
      }
    } else {
      // Non-repeating: full-width single image
      ctx.drawImage(img, worldToScreenX(0, scroll), worldToScreenY(0, scroll), level.mapSize.width, level.mapSize.height);
    }
    ctx.restore();
  }
}
```

`repeatX: true` does modulo wrap — never clamps, never snaps when player walks back. Distant layers (low parallax) barely scroll, near layers scroll fast. All from one 1280-wide image per layer.

### Recommended parallax values

| Layer | parallax | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| sky | 0.02-0.06 | almost static — distant clouds / sky |
| far_bg | 0.15-0.25 | distant mountains, far city silhouette |
| mid_bg | 0.40-0.55 | mid-distance buildings, trees, structures |
| near_bg | 0.75-0.95 | foreground silhouettes, grass, fences |

Avoid `parallax: 1.0` — that's the same speed as foreground platforms, defeats the parallax illusion.

## Platforms — tile library, NEVER stretch

The biggest visual bug in past side-scroll projects: agent generates a 512×512 platform prop, drops it into level JSON with `{ image, w: 760, h: 100 }`, runtime stretches → 5× squash → looks awful.

**Default platform_visual_strategy = `tile_library`**:

- `generate2dmap`'s `platform_strip` workflow outputs a **strip pack**: `left-cap.png + middle-tile.png + right-cap.png`. The middle is designed to repeat seamlessly.
- Use the **EXTRACTED individual files**, NOT the combined `sheet.png`. The combined sheet has cell-padding gaps that cause visual seams between platform pieces.
- Schema:

```json
"shared_platform_library": {
  "stone_tile": {
    "left":  { "image": "assets/maps/.../platform_strip-1.png" },
    "mid":   { "image": "assets/maps/.../platform_strip-2.png", "tileW": 64 },
    "right": { "image": "assets/maps/.../platform_strip-3.png" }
  }
},
"platforms": [
  { "id": "ground_01", "x": 0,    "y": 600, "w": 760, "h": 96,
    "tile": "stone_tile", "renderMode": "three-piece" },
  { "id": "ledge_02",  "x": 820,  "y": 520, "w": 320, "h": 32,
    "tile": "stone_tile", "renderMode": "three-piece", "oneWay": true }
]
```

- Renderer: draw left-cap, then loop middle every `tileW` until close to right edge, then right-cap. **Never stretch.**

If the user explicitly wants set-piece platforms ("each platform is its own unique landmark"), use `renderMode: "natural"` and require `platform.w === image.naturalW`. OGF's Scene editor warns when `renderMode` is unset and `platform.w` doesn't match the image's natural dimensions.

## Collision — separate from visuals

Don't infer collision from `platforms[].h`. Use a `colliders[]` array:

```json
"colliders": [
  { "id": "col_ground_01", "shape": "rect",
    "x": 0, "y": 600, "w": 760, "h": 12,
    "type": "platform", "oneWay": false, "links": "ground_01" }
]
```

Collision rect height is typically smaller than the visual platform height (e.g. 12px collision for a 96px-tall platform — only the top edge counts).

`type` values: `platform` (solid floor/wall), `wall` (left/right bound), `hazard` (damages player), `kill` (instant death), `trigger` (zone event).

`platforms[].solid` is OBSOLETE — colliders[] is the source of truth for collision.

## Sprites — `side_with_flip` direction

Side-scrollers use `sprite_direction: side_with_flip` — generate sprites facing right only, runtime mirrors them when facing left:

```js
ctx.save();
if (player.facing.x < 0) {
  ctx.translate(player.x + player.w, player.y);
  ctx.scale(-1, 1);
  drawSprite(ctx, sheet, anim, 0, 0, t);
} else {
  drawSprite(ctx, sheet, anim, player.x, player.y, t);
}
ctx.restore();
```

Cuts sprite generation in half (no need for separate left-facing sheets) and is what 2D action platformers have done since the NES.

## Map size + camera

Spec.md camera mode = `follow` for scrolling levels, `locked` for boss arenas:

- `mapSize.width = stage_segment_count × viewport.width` where `viewport.width = 1280`.
- **`stage_segment_count` default = 5** (5120px ≈ 4 viewport-widths of scrolling play, the right length for a proper platformer level). Previous default of 2 (2560px) was set when each segment needed its own background art; tileable parallax decouples level length from art cost, so longer is now free.
  - **5** = normal scrolling level (5120, ~4 viewport widths after spawn)
  - **3-4** = short side-quest / introductory level (3840-5120)
  - **6-8** = long story level (7680-10240) — use when the spec describes a substantial journey
  - **1** = boss room (1280, locked camera)
- Boss rooms use `camera.mode = locked` with `mapSize === viewport`.
- Parallax layer PNGs stay at **1280×720** regardless of mapSize.width — they tile via `repeatX: true` (see `recipes/side-scroll/parallax-layers.md` and common.md §"Background dimensions" case B).

## Common pitfalls (don't repeat past project mistakes)

1. **Camera lookahead snap on facing flip** — always smooth via lerp. (See Camera section above.)
2. **Parallax srcX clamp** — layer "snaps" walking back. Use modulo wrap.
3. **Layer image = mapSize.width** — distant layers barely scroll because their `srcX` range is tiny. Distant layers should be small + tile.
4. **Platform image stretched to gameplay-sized rect** — squashes art. Use tile library.
5. **`platforms[].solid: true`** — OGF Scene editor doesn't honor it. Use `colliders[]`.
6. **Strip-pack referenced via `sheet.png`** — has cell-padding gaps. Use extracted `*-1.png` / `*-2.png` / `*-3.png`.
7. **Collision body = sprite size** — corner clipping. Body should be 60-80% of sprite size.

Each of these has bitten previous OGF test projects. Avoid by following the patterns above.

## Recommended module split (side-scroll)

**Phase 0** installs the side-scroll foundation seed (see common.md §"Phase 0 — install foundation seed"). Side-scroll seed ships 22 modules with the layout below — adopt verbatim from `.ogf/foundation-seeds/side-scroll/seed/` rather than re-deriving:

Per `common.md` "Module architecture (universal)", every project gets the universal modules. Side-scroll adds these on top, with entity code split into `src/entities/`:

| Module | Responsibility | Approx LOC |
|---|---|---|
| `src/physics.js` | Gravity, 2-axis integrate (move x, resolve walls; move y, resolve platforms) | ~60 |
| `src/platforms.js` | `platformColliders()` + `damageColliders()` filters | ~15 |
| `src/parallax.js` | Layer sort + opacity + repeatX rendering | ~20 |
| `src/camera.js` | Follow camera + clamp to mapSize + shake | ~40 |
| `src/collision.js` | rectsOverlap, bodyRect helpers | ~30 |
| `src/particles.js` | burstParticles + updateParticles | ~40 |
| `src/render.js` | drawLevel orchestration + drawEntityAnimation helper | ~270 |
| `src/scene.js` | switchScene + buildSceneRuntime + updateScene + updateHazards | ~165 |
| `src/hud.js` | HP / lives / score / pause | ~75 |
| `src/dialogue.js` | Story panel | ~15 |
| `src/entities/player.js` | FSM: idle / walk / jump / attack, movement | ~100 |
| `src/entities/enemy.js` | Patrol + chase + melee/ranged AI | ~120 |
| `src/entities/attack.js` | Hitbox lifecycle + procedural slash VFX | ~75 |
| `src/entities/projectiles.js` | Straight-line projectile entities | ~35 |

Total per-project: ~22 src files, ~1,400 LOC (seed baseline). Project additions for spec-specific systems (energy meter, combo chain, multi-weapon) bring it to ~1,800-2,500 LOC.

Genre-specific config files:

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `data/physics-config.json` | Gravity, jump impulse, max-fall, run accel, friction, wall-cling slide |
| `data/enemy-stats.json` | Per-enemy HP / damage / speed / contact-damage |
| `data/camera-config.json` | Window width/height, lookahead distance, vertical snap |
| `data/audio-config.json` | sfx tone freqs, gain |

Identity files:

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `data/levels.json` | Level registry |
| `data/<level_id>.json` | Per level: parallax layers, platforms, enemies, hazards, pickups, exits, boss zone |
| `data/enemies.json` | Enemy catalog (id, sprite paths, animations) |
| `data/projectiles.json` | Projectile catalog |

## Reference implementation + recipes

The side-scroll foundation seed at `.ogf/foundation-seeds/side-scroll/seed/` is the reference structure. Copy it via Phase 0 then fill in spec-specific values. Source reference repo at `D:/Sengoku-Era-act-ogf/` — a complete playable Sengoku ronin action platformer (Moonlit Ronin → Castle Gate Boss), the seed was extracted from there with catalogs emptied and player id genericized.

**Read these recipes at phase execution time** (alongside the foundation seed's SEED.md):

| Implementing | Read recipe FIRST |
|---|---|
| `src/entities/attack.js` (player melee swing + hitbox) | `.ogf/recipes/side-scroll/combat-melee.md` |
| `src/parallax.js` + level `layers[]` schema | `.ogf/recipes/side-scroll/parallax-layers.md` |
| Platforms with shared_platform_library | `.ogf/recipes/side-scroll/platform-three-piece.md` |
| `src/entities/enemy.js` (patrol + ranged AI) | `.ogf/recipes/side-scroll/enemy-patrol.md` |
| Hazards (fire/spike) + pit-kill zones | `.ogf/recipes/side-scroll/hazards-and-pits.md` |
| Ranged enemy projectiles | `.ogf/recipes/side-scroll/projectiles.md` |
| Checkpoints + lives + respawn | `.ogf/recipes/side-scroll/checkpoints-respawn.md` |

Each recipe has a "When to use / When NOT to use" section — if your project's mechanic differs (combo attacks, charged attack, homing projectiles, etc.) the recipe explicitly tells you to fork rather than apply.
